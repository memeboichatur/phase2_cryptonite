# 1. Linux CLI - Shells Bells
Explore the Linux command-line interface and use it to unveil Christmas mysteries.


The unthinkable has happened - McSkidy has been kidnapped. Without her, Wareville’s defenses are faltering, and Christmas itself hangs by a thread. But panic won’t save the season. A long road lies ahead to uncover what truly happened. The TBFC (The Best Festival Company) team already brainstorms what to do next, and their first lead points to the tbfc-web01, a Linux server processing Christmas wishlists. Somewhere within its data may lie the truth: traces of McSkidy’s final actions, or perhaps the clues to King Malhare’s twisted vision for EASTMAS.

## Solution:
TASK 1->


used the vm in the website to launch up the cli and started looking around. there was a readme file
```
mcskidy@tbfc-web01:~$ cat README.txt
For all TBFC members,
Yesterday I spotted yet another Eggsploit on our servers.
Not sure what it means yet, but Wareville is in danger.
To be prepared, I'll write the security guide by tomorrow.
As a precaution, I'll also hide the guide from plain view.
~ McSkidy

```

as the file said the file will be hidden from plain view, it made sense to use ls -a
nothing was there. on further inspection, i noticed the guides directory. CDed to that and used ls -a

```
I think King Malhare from HopSec Island is preparing for an attack.
Not sure what his goal is, but Eggsploits on our servers are not good.
Be ready to protect Christmas by following this Linux guide:

Check /var/log/ and grep inside, let the logs become your guide.
Look for eggs that want to hide, check their shells for what's inside!

P.S. Great job finding the guide. Your flag is:
-----------------------------------------------
THM{learning-linux-cli}
-----------------------------------------------
```

asked me to check /var/log/ and grep logs etc. a lot of .log files were present here. the website asked me to check auth.log for failed passwords. doing this and checking the eggshell.sh i got another flag.

finally, the program asked me to check the bash history for a hidden flag using the ```history``` command. doing this gave me the final flag

# 2. Phishing - Merry Clickmas
Learn how to use the Social-Engineer Toolkit to send phishing emails.

In light of several recent cyber security threats against The Best Festival Company (TBFC), the local red team has scheduled several penetration tests. The red teamers proceeded to carry out a regular penetration test against their TBFC. Part of this exercise is to ensure that the employees are diligent when clicking links and that the company is well protected against the latest phishing attacks. This type of authorised phishing is a proven way to learn whether the cyber security awareness training has fruited.

In this task, you will be part of the TBFC local red team with the elves Recon McRed, Exploit McRed, and Pivot McRed. You will help them plan and execute their phishing campaign. It is time to see if more cyber security awareness training is required.

## Solution:
the challenge already gave us a python script that hosted a fake login page and captures all credentials. first i fired this up using ```./server.py```

next i used SET(Social-Engineer-Toolkit) and navigated my way around to perform my social engineering mass mailer attack. i targetted ```factory@wareville.thm``` and waited for the recipient to access my dummy website. the login credentials showed up on my python script as soon as he did.

login: ``` admin ```
password ``` unranked-wisdom-anthem ```

next i browsed to the mailbox of the factory to check if the same password was reused, and indeed it was. i was able to gain access to the entire email of the targetted factory. i was asked to find the total number of toys expected for delivery, which was 1984000
