# 1. Linux CLI - Shells Bells
Explore the Linux command-line interface and use it to unveil Christmas mysteries.


The unthinkable has happened - McSkidy has been kidnapped. Without her, Wareville’s defenses are faltering, and Christmas itself hangs by a thread. But panic won’t save the season. A long road lies ahead to uncover what truly happened. The TBFC (The Best Festival Company) team already brainstorms what to do next, and their first lead points to the tbfc-web01, a Linux server processing Christmas wishlists. Somewhere within its data may lie the truth: traces of McSkidy’s final actions, or perhaps the clues to King Malhare’s twisted vision for EASTMAS.

## Solution:
TASK 1->


used the vm in the website to launch up the cli and started looking around. there was a readme file
```
mcskidy@tbfc-web01:~$ cat README.txt
For all TBFC members,
Yesterday I spotted yet another Eggsploit on our servers.
Not sure what it means yet, but Wareville is in danger.
To be prepared, I'll write the security guide by tomorrow.
As a precaution, I'll also hide the guide from plain view.
~ McSkidy

```

as the file said the file will be hidden from plain view, it made sense to use ls -a
nothing was there. on further inspection, i noticed the guides directory. CDed to that and used ls -a

```
I think King Malhare from HopSec Island is preparing for an attack.
Not sure what his goal is, but Eggsploits on our servers are not good.
Be ready to protect Christmas by following this Linux guide:

Check /var/log/ and grep inside, let the logs become your guide.
Look for eggs that want to hide, check their shells for what's inside!

P.S. Great job finding the guide. Your flag is:
-----------------------------------------------
THM{learning-linux-cli}
-----------------------------------------------
```

asked me to check /var/log/ and grep logs etc. a lot of .log files were present here. the website asked me to check auth.log for failed passwords. doing this and checking the eggshell.sh i got another flag.

finally, the program asked me to check the bash history for a hidden flag using the ```history``` command. doing this gave me the final flag

# 2. Phishing - Merry Clickmas
Learn how to use the Social-Engineer Toolkit to send phishing emails.

In light of several recent cyber security threats against The Best Festival Company (TBFC), the local red team has scheduled several penetration tests. The red teamers proceeded to carry out a regular penetration test against their TBFC. Part of this exercise is to ensure that the employees are diligent when clicking links and that the company is well protected against the latest phishing attacks. This type of authorised phishing is a proven way to learn whether the cyber security awareness training has fruited.

In this task, you will be part of the TBFC local red team with the elves Recon McRed, Exploit McRed, and Pivot McRed. You will help them plan and execute their phishing campaign. It is time to see if more cyber security awareness training is required.

## Solution:
the challenge already gave us a python script that hosted a fake login page and captures all credentials. first i fired this up using ```./server.py```

next i used SET(Social-Engineer-Toolkit) and navigated my way around to perform my social engineering mass mailer attack. i targetted ```factory@wareville.thm``` and waited for the recipient to access my dummy website. the login credentials showed up on my python script as soon as he did.

login: ``` admin ```
password ``` unranked-wisdom-anthem ```

next i browsed to the mailbox of the factory to check if the same password was reused, and indeed it was. i was able to gain access to the entire email of the targetted factory. i was asked to find the total number of toys expected for delivery, which was 1984000

# 4. AI in Security - old sAInt nick
TBFC, adventurous as ever, is trialling their brand new cyber security AI assistant, Van SolveIT, which is capable of helping the elves with all their defensive, offensive, and software needs. They decide to put this flashy technology to use as Christmas approaches, to identify, confirm, and resolve any potential vulnerabilities, before any nay-sayers can.

## Solution:
for the first challenge, we used AI to build a python script which perfoms a sql exploit to our target website ```10.48.147.245:5000```

i used the script generated, only having to input the target ip address. doing this ->

the script when ran with ``` python3 script.py``` gave the output
```

```
which gave the admin success message, along with the flag ```THM{SQLI_EXPLOIT}``` for the attack stage. 
moving onto the next stage, it asked for us to paste the logs of the attack we just performed, for the AI to analyse. this was pretty straightforward and here is its analysis

```
LOG ENTRIES
198.51.100.22 - - [03/Oct/2025:09:03:11 +0100] "POST /login.php HTTP/1.1" 200 642 "-" "python-requests/2.31.0" "username=alice%27+OR+1%3D1+--+-&password=test"

---

### 1. Analysis of the Logs
- IP Address: The attacker\u2019s IP address is 198.51.100.22.
- Time and Date: The attack occurred on 3 October 2025 at 09:03.
- URL: The page accessed was /login.php.
- Username: The username attempted was alice%27+OR+1%3D1+--+-&password=test.
- SQL Injection: The password parameter contains an SQL injection attempt: alice%27 OR 1=1. This indicates a vulnerability in the application, as SQL injection exploits untrusted user input.
- Conclusion: This log entry highlights a potential SQL injection attack, emphasizing the importance of monitoring logs for suspicious activity.

---

### 2. Why Logging Matters
Logging is essential for detecting security threats like SQL injection. It allows teams to identify patterns, track anomalies, and respond to incidents in real-time. By analyzing log entries, blue team members can:
- Identify vulnerabilities in the application.
- Understand the scope of potential threats.
- Enable proactive measures like patching or updating systems.

---

### 3. Blue Team Perspective
- Vulnerability Identification: The log reveals a potential flaw in the application, prompting immediate attention.
- Monitoring: Teams should continue monitoring logs for other signs of exploitation.
- Response: Actions like applying patches or reviewing user input validation can mitigate the risk.

```

The next stage gave us an analysis of todays aoc application, and also put remarks on safer sql coding ->

```
Explanation of Vulnerability:
The code initializes $user and $pass with ??, which means they are set to empty strings. This allows attackers to inject malicious data into the database, which can then be used for SQL injection attacks. For example, if the username is 'admin' and the password is '123', the code would output those values, which could be used to execute arbitrary SQL queries.

Why this is vulnerable:
SQL injection occurs when an attacker can inject malicious code into a database, which can be by allowing unvalidated input. This vulnerability is a classic example of how simple code can be exploited for serious security issues.

Tools and Techniques for Secure Development:
- Use OWASP Top 10 for secure coding practices
- Implement input validation
- Use prepared statements
- Use SQL map for secure database interactions 
```

completing this stages gave us the final flag ```THM{AI_MANIA}```

# 5.IDOR - Santa’s Little IDOR
Learn about IDOR while helping pentest the TrypresentMe website.

The elves of Wareville are on high alert since McSkidy went missing. Recently, the support team has been receiving many calls from parents who can't activate vouchers on the TryPresentMe website. They also mentioned they are receiving many targeted phishing emails containing information that is not public. The support team is wary and has enlisted the help of the TBFC staff. When looking into this peculiar case, they discovered a suspiciously named account named Sir Carrotbane, which has many vouchers assigned to it. For now, they have deleted the account and retrieved the vouchers. But something is going on. Can you help the TBFC staff investigate the TryPresentMe website and fix the vulnerabilities?

## Solution:
This challenge gave a good overview on IDOR - Insecure Direct Object Reference. 
It started with having us fire up the attackbox and load up the target page with the following credentials
```
Username:niels
Password:TryHackMe#2025
IP address/Website:http://10.48.129.122
```
It then had us inspect the page, move on to the storage tab -> local storage and then brute force the user value from 10, until we found a user with 10 children. this worked with the user 15.
