## Solution:
this one was quite easy, as uni is already teaching us c. reading the source code file, i could figure out the code used gets, which meant i had to perform a stack overflow. i also noticed the code was programmed to write the flag to a txt if this happened. i therefore typed AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA in the netcat instance, giving me the flag

## Solution:
looking at the hint, i saw it was based on format string vunerability. i could make some sense of this being taught format specifiers in c. looking at the source code, the program had 2 stages, both of which needed format specifiers as errors to move to the next stage. the condition for the first one was for the characters to be greater than 64. this was possible with the grilled cheese as it contained %114d, satisfying the first condtition. the second one, reading the options was classic cheesecake, as it contained a %s. running this caused a segmentation fault, which was needed to print out the flag
