# Binary Exploitation

# 1. Buffer Overflow 0
Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? The program is available here. You can view source here.

## Solution:
this one was quite easy, as uni is already teaching us c. reading the source code file, i could figure out the code used gets, which meant i had to perform a stack overflow. i also noticed the code was programmed to write the flag to a txt if this happened. i therefore typed AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA in the netcat instance, giving me the flag

# Format String 0
Can you use your knowledge of format strings to make the customers happy?

## Solution:
looking at the hint, i saw it was based on format string vunerability. i could make some sense of this being taught format specifiers in c. looking at the source code, the program had 2 stages, both of which needed format specifiers as errors to move to the next stage. the condition for the first one was for the characters to be greater than 64. this was possible with the grilled cheese as it contained %114d, satisfying the first condtition. the second one, reading the options was classic cheesecake, as it contained a %s. running this caused a segmentation fault, which was needed to print out the flag

# 3. Clutter Overflow
Clutter, clutter everywhere and not a byte to use.
nc mars.picoctf.net 31890

## Solution:
looking at the source code, i figured we needed to exceed the 256 limit of the array and trigger the 0xdeadbeef which would be stored next to it using overflow. typing the following generated the flag.

```

My room is so cluttered...
What do you see?
code == 0xdeadbeef: how did that happen??
take a flag for your troubles
picoCTF{c0ntr0ll3d_clutt3r_1n_my_buff3r}
```

## Flag: 
picoCTF{c0ntr0ll3d_clutt3r_1n_my_buff3r}
## Concepts Learnt: 
0xdeadbeef is a common key for debugging 

``` setbuf(stdout, NULL);
  setbuf(stdin, NULL);
  setbuf(stderr, NULL); 
  ``` 
This code disables buffering for the three standard I/O streams: standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout), and standard error (stderr).
